# Matchbox
Scan your environment for people with the same interests

## Description
Matchbox is a Social Media Application with the purpose of discovering people in your environment sharing the same interests, favors, preferences etcetera on subjects like music, art, literature, sports, politics and so on.

## Purpose
The purpose of the app is for individuals to check if in the public space they're in at a certain time, there are people they can relate to.
The app allows the user to share whatever they want, give these items a rating - rather in importance or impact than in like or dislike - and let the user decide if and at what level of 'match' they would like to get in touch with other users and on what level, be it physical or through social media, be it instantly or at some other time.
## Features
The app may contain a chatbox, to contact a person in your environment, although it isn't a relational tool. The app focusses on informing the user that in the (public) space they find themselves there are more users with the same interests. And only if the Level of Match is within the set boundaries will users send and/or receive detailed information about each other.
If further contact is desired it is up to the user to take action.
